- Web application creation is a lot of work for sure. The process that companies can use to store and project information for users is vast. The data that is collected is relativity the same and is fitted to the needs and the interface specific to the company and the users they reach.

- The data that YouTube uses is a video format. The video data is not just one video, it is in multiple of formats in various servers. YouTube will also store the video data in various resolutions to include the various formats. As it is a google platform it will collect data from searches, geographic location, IP address, email, etc.  YouTube uses a pipeline called viper that handles all the encoding and formats. It will also do things like fingerprinting and proofing for copyright. YouTube reaches a wide verity of platforms and interfaces. this includes but not limited to computers, TV, and video game consoles.

- Amazon collects data from users to use for various purposes. This includes collaborative filtering, what you buy, the company’s you look at, and IP address. Amazon will also use external datasets for the purpose of collecting census data. Amazon uses MYSQL, Oracle, and My SQL Server to manage its database. A lot like YouTube it can reach a lot of different interfaces; Tv’s, computers, and video game consoles.

- Reddit collects data from the user. This could include IP address browser types, cookies, user agent strings, OS info, reference URL, and of course user input data. Reddit uses PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and zookeeper. Memcached is what is used to speed up many of the form lookups. Reddit has a PC/Mac, mobile based interface s its primary use.

- What I learned from the info above is there seems to be a pattern with a splash of verity. They all use some form of data manucaption but in different forms. The data they collect is not just user generated content but data to help grow their business or data that is generated to assist users or marketing by helping programs feed you info or ads based on how the user reacts with the interface.
