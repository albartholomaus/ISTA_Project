- My app will be able to create and edit virtual classrooms. “Teachers” should be able create classrooms on specific topics.  Teachers should be able to create graphical material to be presented to users/students to read, watch, and edit. Students should then be able to interact with the material in such a way they see fit. End goal is to provide an environment to the function to teach a topic on a subject that fit the needs of a student or body. 

- A T-SQL server will be implemented to contain data that would be recalled for inventory. The data should be at a minimum for the students; first and last name, email, current learning topic, platform on which students use to access the web app. Another table should be able to store user data the verify logon credentials and storied securely.  Server should be able to hold date files used for projection images and text tile.

- Programing needs to reflect on users and super users query data. Data should be formatted to specific queries and presented in a specific way that is necessary. Software will display learning material to the students. Learning material will have the option to make learning material such as, quizzes, test, homework and interactive by providing users information in the form a question and then return answers in texted base format or video-based format. 

- Will use web app format to interface between the server and the use.  Uses will provide login credentials to app. Depending on user credentials, class leaders should be able to tailor classes to fit needs. Student will be able to have an environment to interact between material as needed, click on various buttons to access grades, material, contact info.

- The App is poised to be a great way to engage people and create custom learning environments. Programing should reflect mobility and customizable interfaces. To get the full picture think liked in learning but having anyone to register and create class.
